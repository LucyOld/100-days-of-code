**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**Today's Progress**: Exercises on FreeCodeCamp + Wrapping Head Around Github

**Thoughts** Today was an 'easing back into coding day'. After a big break from any sort of work over the festive period I decided to complete some FreeCodeCamp lessons. I whizzed through lessons 22-75 of the Front End Developer Certificate as a refresher. I also took the time to work out how to use GitHub. I still don't know everything, but it is a tool I have been avoiding using. One of the benefits of this challenge will be that I gain the ability to use GitHub to aid my workflow in the future.

Not much today other than a tweet of commitment to the challenge and a summary of what I have done!
