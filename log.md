# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Exercises on FreeCodeCamp + Wrapping Head Around Github

**Thoughts** Today was an 'easing back into coding day'. After a big break from any sort of work over the festive period I decided to complete some FreeCodeCamp lessons. I whizzed through lessons 22-75 of the Front End Developer Certificate as a refresher. I also took the time to work out how to use GitHub. I still don't know everything, but it is a tool I have been avoiding using. One of the benefits of this challenge will be that I gain the ability to use GitHub to aid my workflow in the future.

Not much today other than a tweet of commitment to the challenge and a summary of what I have done!
