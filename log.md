# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Exercises on FreeCodeCamp + Wrapping Head Around Github

**Thoughts** Today was an 'easing back into coding day'. After a big break from any sort of work over the festive period I decided to complete some FreeCodeCamp lessons. I whizzed through lessons 22-75 of the Front End Developer Certificate as a refresher. I also took the time to work out how to use GitHub. I still don't know everything, but it is a tool I have been avoiding using. One of the benefits of this challenge will be that I gain the ability to use GitHub to aid my workflow in the future.

Not much today other than a tweet of commitment to the challenge and a summary of what I have done!

### Day 2: January 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Exercises on FreeCodeCamp + jQuery project

**Thoughts** I continued doing the jQuery exercises and expanded my knowledge further. it was also a great refresher for animating elements. I then built a basic tribute page on Audrey Heburn as practice for Bootstrap skills.

### Day 3: January 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished first Edition of my Portfolio - finally!

**Thoughts** I finally got around to completing my portfolio site. It is still a work in progress and will probably change a lot over time and as my skills improve. It is very basic as I don't have an enormous amount of projects to show. We all have to start somewhere though right!
